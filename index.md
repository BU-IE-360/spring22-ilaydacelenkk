## Welcome to My GitHub Page 

## How to add Links of files to Your Github Repository:

Check [my repository](https://github.com/BU-IE-360/spring22-ilaydacelenkk) to see the folder names and the uploaded files.

### Correct linking of .html:

* [Correct Example 1](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/spring22-ilaydacelenkk/IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): The .html file is in the same location with your index file.
* [Correct Example 2](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/spring22-ilaydacelenkk/files/IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): The .html file is in a folder called files and this folder is in the same location with your index file.

* [Wrong linking](IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): Do not do this! As you can see you cannot see the .html outputs.



### Homework 1
* [Description of Homework 1](IE360_Spring22_HW1.pdf): Unlike the .html files, for the .pdf files this works. 
* [Description of Homework 1](files/IE360_Spring22_HW1.pdf): If your .pdf file is in a folder, you can link it like this.
